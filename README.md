# Design-of-FSM-to-detect-the-sequence-1011-using-Verilog
The ”1011” sequence detector’s FSM level of abstraction is effectively applied in Verilog design and is synthesised and simulated using Cadence software. The DUT is also validated using the structural description, which functioned as the golden reference model. The reference model exhibits minimal time, area and power parameters when compared to the FSM level of abstraction. We consider the FSM level of abstraction to be the best way to build the sequence detector since constructing the schematic diagram from scratch in structural description prevents the compiler from optimising the design to meet requirements that are not merely concerned with exactness.
